# Connecting the app to the SchoolOS backend

The backend lives in `schoolOS_backend`; its full list of app changes is `docs/APP_CHANGES.md` there. This page says what
the app has done and how to try it.

## Switching it on

The app runs on its built-in demo data unless it is told where the backend is:

```
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000/api/v1      # Android emulator to a local backend
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://api.schoolos.ng/api/v1   # a real server
```

With no value nothing changes: the demo login, demo memberships and local-only records all work as before, and every
existing test runs on that path. With a value, the login screen asks for an email and password and signs in for real.

## Done (foundation, steps A1 to A3)

| Piece | File | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address and switch | `lib/core/network/api_config.dart` | `API_BASE_URL`; `enabled` is false when empty |
| API client | `lib/core/network/api_client.dart` | Attaches the token, renews an expired one once (shared by concurrent requests), and throws only three things: `ApiOfflineException` (try later), `SessionExpiredException` (sign in again), `ApiException` (the server's own words) |
| Tokens | `lib/core/auth/token_store.dart` | Secure storage on the device; memory in tests |
| Sign in and out | `lib/core/auth/auth_repository.dart` | Signs in, loads the person's schools (`me/`) into the school session; a role this app version does not know is skipped |
| Sending changes | `lib/core/sync/http_sync_transport.dart` | Sends one queued change to `sync/push/`. Accepted, conflict and rejected map to the engine's; "no signal", server trouble and an expired sign-in become `SyncRetryLater`, never a failure of the change |
| Downloading | `lib/core/sync/sync_puller.dart`, `sync_store.dart` | `sync/pull/` from the saved cursor, page by page; the cursor is saved after each page; a record with an unsent edit on the device is left alone; deleted records are removed |
| The engine | `lib/core/sync/sync_engine.dart` | Sends, then pulls. With no signal the change goes back in the queue in order and the run stops (nothing is marked failed). Reports `pulled`, `stoppedOffline`, `needsSignIn` |
| Storage | `lib/core/database/local_database.dart` | New `sync_cursors` table (per school and membership), `deleteLocalRecord`, `markMutationPending` |
| Login screen | `lib/features/authentication/presentation/login_page.dart` | Real sign-in when a backend is set: email field, plain error messages, "not connected to any school yet" message, no demo panel |

Tests: `test/core/` (74 tests) cover each layer with a fake server, in-memory storage and, for the queue rules, real SQLite;
`test/backend_login_and_banner_test.dart` covers the login screen and banner (9 tests).

## Fixed on the way

The app did not compile: two identical `TransportActionResult` classes were imported together by the transport route and
rider-assignment repositories. The unused import was removed.

## Done (step 2): keeping in step, and being signed out

| Piece | File | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coordinator | `lib/core/sync/sync_coordinator.dart` | Runs a round when the app starts, after a change is queued (short pause, so a burst is one round), when the app comes back to the front, and on a timer. One round at a time; a change queued during a round makes another follow. Offline: retries 15 s, 30 s, ... up to 5 min, and at once when the app returns. Exposes `status`, `message`, `lastSyncedAt`, `changes` |
| Queue hook | `LocalDatabase.onMutationQueued` | Every screen already queues through the database, so no screen had to change |
| Banner | `lib/app/sync_status_banner.dart` | A strip across the whole app: offline (work is safe), sign-in ended, lost access. The last two offer "Sign in" |
| Start-up | `lib/app/app_services.dart` | A saved school with no saved sign-in starts at the login screen; the coordinator starts when a school is open, and after login |
| Signing in again | `lib/app/app.dart` | Stops syncing, signs out (unsent work stays on the device), opens the login screen |

### Queue rules found and fixed on the way (`LocalDatabase`)

The server remembers its answer to each change by id. Sending the same id again gets the same answer, so the old queue
rules could lose work once a real server was involved. Now:

1. **Editing a record again before anything was sent** folds into the waiting change and keeps its id **and its place in the
   queue** (it used to move to the back, which would send a comment before the post it is on).
2. **Editing it after an attempt to send it** is a *new* change. The first may already be applied on the server with the
   reply lost; editing it in place would make the server ignore the edit.
3. **A change the server refused** is not sent again by itself, and no longer crowds out new work (refused changes used to
   be retried every round and could fill the batch). The next edit replaces it under a new id; retrying by hand also uses
   a new id.
4. Queue times are strictly increasing, so order is never a tie.

The database can now run in tests (`databasePath: ':memory:'`), so these rules are tested against real SQLite
(`test/core/local_database_queue_test.dart`).

## Not done yet (next)

1. **Sync Center screen**: show `SyncCoordinator` status, last sync time and counts, and a "Sync now" button; let a person
   retry or discard a refused change (it lists them already).
2. **Screens reload when new data arrives**: they read the local database when they open. Listen to `coordinator.changes`.
3. **Losing one school but keeping others**: the banner sends the person through sign-in again; a school picker would be gentler.
4. **Access** (`access/me/`, hiding screens, the blocking flow) and the **notifications inbox**.
5. Everything in `schoolOS_backend/docs/APP_CHANGES.md` sections B to H, feature by feature.

## Known problems that are not from this work

- 47 tests fail, and none of them is from this work: 40 in the Teacher module (wrong expected figures), 6 in
  `demo_login_navigation_test.dart` and 1 in `finance_fee_structure_feature_test.dart`. The last seven are a layout
  overflow (a row 109 px too wide in a shared widget at the test screen size). They were hidden while the app did not
  compile. They fail the same way with the original login page.
- **Fixed:** the login screen's brand header overflowed on narrow screens (a `Column` in a `Row` without `Expanded`).
- **Fixed:** the backend now has the `driver` role (workspace screens, staff role, school-life access), and the app's
  delegated-approver roles include it.
